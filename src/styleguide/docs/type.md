We use the wonderfully-named Boing by A2-Type across all our print and digital media.

#### Boing
Boing is a bold, rounded sans serif font ideal for a range of communication needs. The face is soft, yet solid, determined, yet friendly. Boing has been designed as a display face, but it also works equally well in running text.


### Font sizes
We have a select number of font sizes, chosen for harmonious balance. In the larger sizes, we bump up the font weight and in the smaller sizes, we decrease the font weight for greater clarity in the typeface.

```js { "noeditor": true }
import Button from 'wonderbly-atoms/Button';

<Button>Hi</Button>
```

### Line height
Rather than adhering to an arbitrary vertical grid for rhythm, we use relative line height for each of our fonts sizes. The formula used to work it out is lineHeight + 8. So for example, at the base size of 16px, the line height would equate to 24px.

As some of our font sizes are dynamic based on the current viewport width, the line heights are dynamic also.
